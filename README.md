# AngularSSRSample

Correction (Apr 21):

The proper way to test what content is shown at <b>page load</b> is to do <b>Right Click > View page source</b>.

You will notice that BookAppSSR will show the full content at page source, while BookAppNormal will only show <code>\<app-root\></code>.

This respository is a introduction to Angular SSR for Home Depot Academy (Home Depot's internship program).
  
1. BookAppNormal is the normal application

2. BookAppSSR is what happens after it is converted to a angular universal application
  
3. The powerpoint included serve as a companion powerpoint and should be viewed together while reading the code
